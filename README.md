## About the Project

The factors determining the ability of humans to be aware of language and to understand it, is a
large linguistic research area. Part of this is the understanding of relative clauses. Researchers
have the hypothesis that subject relative sentences are easier to comprehend for children than
object relative ones. Additionally, if there is a match in characteristics between the subject and
the object of the sentence, for example they are the same gender or animal, this should also
influence the understanding of relative clauses. In this report this hypothesis it was examined
based on samples of children’s ability to repeat a sentence.

The code is structured into two parts. In the first part we will take a look onto the data set in
the exploratory analysis and look if we can find interesting structures in our data set. Afterwards
we will propose a model, validate it and come up with an improved, robust model.

## The Code 

The code is fully in R and structured into two scripts: The exploratory part and the modelling part. For data rights reasons is the respective dataset not included in this repository. You can find all visualizations done in the code in the graphics folder.
